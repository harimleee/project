        <p>Innisfree Online has renewed its original Innisfree page<br> in the style of Aesop's homepage.<br> The Innisfree's needed information and functions, and created the atmosphere of<br>Aesop's pages.<br> I thought Innisfree's naturalist image and
            Aesop's warm and emotional<br> atmosphere would go well together.<br> You have selected Aesop.<br> As a result, I think the good page was completed without losing the image of<br> Innisfree and the warm emotion of Aesop.</p>

            <p class="ex">The existing Innisfree site had so many menus that I couldn't see the menu at a glance.<br> So we're going to simplify the menu to a total of four, and we're going to divide the sub-menu into<br> each part and we can't see it<br> I changed
                it so that only the menu I wanted can be seen simply.</p>

            <p class="ex">Since it is a shopping site, there are not only many images of the product,<br> The problem was that the entire site looked messy and the product was not visible at a glance<br> because there was a lot of information.<br> So the renewal site
                changed to the simplest image so that the product could stand out.<br> The product images are also drawn and inserted so that only the product can be seen.</p>

                I chose Innisfree's naturalist green color, and the overall background is green and good.<br> I chose ivory color that fits well and gives a clean and warm feeling.<br> There are many colors in the products, so they can stand out.<br>                I used a lot of achromatic colors.
