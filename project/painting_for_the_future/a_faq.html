                <li><a href="#">Can I get a child's reply if I send a letter to the child?</a>
                    <p>The reply written by the child will be received from the Korea World Vision office and sent to the sponsor along with the Korean translation written with the help of the translators.
                        <br><br> ※Note※<br> It may be difficult to read English letters in Africa because they are cursive.</p>

                    <p>Under the 'Child Protection Policy' stipulated by the World Vision International Headquarters, Painting For the Future does not inform the sponsor of the child's contact information nor the sponsor's contact information. I ask for
                        your understanding.
                        <br>
                        <Br>
                        <Br> If the content of the letter to the child is left with your contact or email address, delete this part and forward it to the child. In addition, you cannot enclose business cards in mail such as gifts/letters.

                        <br>
                        <Br>
                        <Br> However, when you send a letter, you can write down your sponsor's address on the envelope, and we will change your address from Painting for the Future to a new envelope without your address.</p>

                <li><a href="#">Is the child's regular subscription cash to the child?</a>
                    <p>Sponsorships are used for 'cash support' of education, living and medical expenses, depending on the circumstances and needs of children and families, and also for 'service support' of programs (after-school learning, special education,
                        camp participation, emotional education programs, etc.).</p>
